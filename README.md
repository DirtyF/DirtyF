### ðŸ‘‹ I'm Frank, I help people build better websites.

I'm currently focusing on https://forestry.io and https://tina.io to help people edit modern and performant websites with ease. I run https://jamstatic.fr a french blog about modern static sites, host the [GÃ©nÃ©ration Statique podcast](https://anchor.fm/jamstatic). I also help maintain [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
